1. Introduction 

1.1 The Problem (Choose a dataset: not too easy, not too hard). General idea, area of knowledge, usefulness of the analysis on the application domain. Attributes, classes.

1.2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data statistics. Outliers. Missing data. Particularities of the dataset. Approaches to deal with these. 

1.3. Attribute selection and/or extraction: Correlation analysis: linear, monotonic. Will some method be considered to try different sets of initial attributes for model training? 



2. Method / Methodology / Results 

2.1. How the method will be evaluated? Separation Train/Validation/Test data? 5-fold cross validation? Different structures of neural nets (number of neurons per layer, number of layers) for evaluation. Initial hyper-parameters of the learning algorithm to be tested (Grid search?). Can missing data and outliers (in different percentages) be forced to evaluate model robustness? 

2.2. Comparative Results. Tables, figures, some discussions and insight.



3. Conclusion

References in general. References that used the dataset.
